## Sleep Cycle Information

- **Sleep cycles** typically last 90 minutes and consist of different stages including light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep
- **Complete cycles** are important for feeling refreshed upon waking
- **Waking between cycles** is generally easier than waking in the middle of a cycle
- Most adults complete **4-6 sleep cycles** per night

## Factors Affecting Sleep Needs

### Individual Variations

- **Genetics**: Some people naturally need more or less sleep
- **Activity level**: More physically active individuals may need additional sleep
- **Health conditions**: Illness, pregnancy, or medical conditions can affect sleep needs
- **Sleep quality**: Poor quality sleep may require longer duration

### Age-Related Changes

- **Sleep architecture changes** with age, affecting sleep quality and duration needs
- **Circadian rhythms** may shift, particularly in teenagers and older adults
- **Sleep efficiency** (time asleep vs. time in bed) often decreases with age

## Sleep Quality Tips

### Sleep Hygiene

- Maintain a **consistent sleep schedule**
- Create a **comfortable sleep environment** (cool, dark, quiet)
- Limit **screen exposure** before bedtime
- Avoid **caffeine and alcohol** close to bedtime

### Optimizing Sleep Cycles

- Use tools like **Drowse** to calculate optimal bedtime and wake-up times
- Aim to wake up at the **end of a sleep cycle** rather than in the middle
- Consider **power naps** of 20-30 minutes if needed during the day
